## Intellectual property

_Foster Forest_ is protected by license IDDN.FR.001.350008.000.S.P.2020.000.30200 (French Agency of Program Protection). Its use and broadcast are free and open-access, but **the following conditions must be accounted for**.

## Scientific posture

_Foster Forest_ conception is in line with the [principles of companion modelling](https://collaboratif.cirad.fr/alfresco/s/d/workspace/SpacesStore/38509a15-6a43-42f8-9cf8-7c31370d2cc4/Leteurtre_2013_ComMod.pdf):
- acknowledging the existence of multiple perspectives and non-academic knowledges on forestry
- sharing these perspectives on collective discussions/debriefings
- a process of adaptive modelling, open and used to stimulate French forest systems.

Participating to _Foster Forest_ does not imply to take any part in any actions following a workshop. This posture allows the workshops to really be open to discussions and to the exploration of novel ideas.
 
## To whom who would use _Foster Forest_

To set a _Foster Forest_ workshop, game facilitators must understand that:

1. _Foster Forest_ was developed in a multifunctional vision of forests, where ecological, productive and social forest services are treated equally. Transforming the software or the leaflets is the sole responsibility of the person modifying them.

2. Organizing a workshop induces a clear explanation of the objectives of the participatory simulations to the participants, and informing them of the existence of this website.

3. Neither _Foster Forest_ team nor AgroParisTech can be taken for responsible of what happens during a workshop. Yet, the team stays at your disposal for further questions on the use of _Foster Forest_ (see the [Contact page](https://timotheefouqueray.github.io/fosterforest/english/contact-eng)).

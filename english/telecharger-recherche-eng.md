# Research / Download the research version

Find on this page the research version of _Foster Forest_, as used in 2019 by Timothée Fouqueray for its doctoral studies. It combines two elements: a software and game leaflets.


[Download the 'Research' version](https://timotheefouqueray.github.io/fosterforest/recherche/FosterForest_Research.zip). _Foster Forest_ runs with CORMAS, a free software freely accessible on [this webpage](http://cormas.cirad.fr).



[Download the game leaflets, including instructions for the game-master to guide a workshop facilitation](https://timotheefouqueray.github.io/fosterforest/recherche/FosterForest_Research-Livrets.zip) (in French).


## Using the Research version

Along with the instructions for the game-master, video tutorials explain the installation of CORMAS and then _Foster Forest_. Even if tailored for the 'Prospective' version, the tutorials provide the necessary elements to launch the 'Research' version.

## Differences between the 'Research' & 'Prospective' versions

The 'Research' version differs from the [Prospective](https://timotheefouqueray.github.io/fosterforest/prospective/prospective) version:
- it has 50 plots, instead of the 32 plots of the 'Prospective' version
- it includes the management of hunting game
- its visual interface is less intuitive in the implementation of players' decisions
- it does not explicitly suggest collective actions to the players (even if possible, at their own initiative).

Moreover, the 'Research' workshops included two questionnaires (one before and one after the game rounds).

This page presents _Foster Forest_'s 'Prospective' version. It combines two elements, both in French: one software, and six booklets (one booklet for each of the five players and one for the game master).

## Software 

[Download the 'Prospective' version (in French).](https://timotheefouqueray.github.io/fosterforest/prospective/FosterForest_Prospective.zip) 

A tutorial explains how to install and use _Foster Forest_ software with Cormas. It is [available on YouTube.](https://youtu.be/qcaCzB8dMss). Feel free to read the [Frequently Asked Questions page](https://timotheefouqueray.github.io/fosterforest/prospective/FAQ) (also in French...).
 
## Booklets

The booklets are freely available on request. To get them, please ask me through the ['Contact' page](https://timotheefouqueray.github.io/fosterforest/contact) and **please indicate why and how you plan to use _Foster Forest_**.

The game master's booklet includes:
- explanations on how to prepare the workshop and the room
- the text for an introductory brief
- the text for debriefing between the game's rounds
- a suggestion for the final collective debriefing.

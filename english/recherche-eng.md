# Research / _Foster Forest_, a research tool

_Foster Forest_ is a serious game created to simulate and stimulate the adaptation of French foresters to climate change. It particularly aims at the exploration of non-technical solutions (economic, organisational, ...). 

_Foster Forest_ is a workshop during half a day, gathering private landholders, a public forester of the French National Forest Office and a mayor. Using a computerized simulation, the players must choose forest operations, in a context where climate impacts rise at every game round. Foster Forest focuses on the way the participants diversify or not their forest management: at what spatial scale? Is it individually, or through public policies, wood or carbon markets, or collective actions?
